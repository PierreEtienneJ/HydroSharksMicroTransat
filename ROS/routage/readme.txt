They are four different algorithms : 
- three are inspired by the living : two Ga : one in 2D one other in 1D, and one Ant Colony Optimization. 
- one from graph theory : dijikstra. 


The 2D-Ga use evolution with mutation or mean between too waypoints. 
The 1D-Ga use reproduction with mutation and genetic crossbreeding. 

Use works only with evolutive algorithms, because they can return one resultat if we need once, even if it's not the best way.
